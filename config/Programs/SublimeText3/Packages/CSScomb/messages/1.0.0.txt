CSScomb Plugin 1.0.0 Changelog:

Be sure to take a look at new settings and modify them if needed.

Fixes:
 - Package name was renamed from 'CSScomb JS' to 'CSScomb'.

New:
 - You can store CSScomb's config right in your Sublime settings.
   Open `Preferences > Package Settings > CSScomb` and see `Settings - Default`
   for an example.
   Note that you can still use `.csscomb.json` files inside your project
   directory.
