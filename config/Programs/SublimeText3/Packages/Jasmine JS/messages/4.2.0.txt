Hello!

Jasmine JS has some new snippets to support arrow functions!

The tab triggers for the new snippets have an `e` appended to them, for example

desc⇥

        describe("Name of the group", function() {
            
        });

desce⇥

        describe('Name of the group', () => {
            
        });


**IMPORTANT**:

Because of the workaround this package uses to provide snippets with double and single quotes (using the `Toggle quotes` command),
it's possible that you have to restart Sublime Text and maybe use toggle quotes again if you were using double quotes. Sorry!

Thanks a lot to @feimosi for the suggestion!

That's all, thanks!
