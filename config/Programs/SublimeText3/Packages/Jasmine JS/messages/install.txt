First of all, thanks for installing Jasmine!

This package is a merge of two existing packages:
@caiogondim's https://github.com/caiogondim "Jasmine BDD" package has been combined with @gja's https://github.com/gja "Jasmine" package.

This repo provides a syntax highlighting, snippets and commands.
If you want to know a bit more or for any issue or feature request, visit the repo (https://github.com/NicoSantangelo/sublime-jasmine).


Thanks again!
