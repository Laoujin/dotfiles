Welcome to the TypeScript plugin for Sublime Text!

If you were previously using the 'TypeScript' package from Eric Clemmons
(https://github.com/ericclemmons/sublime-typescript) via Package Control,
this has now been redirected to this 'TypeScript' package from Microsoft.

Details about this package and its feature can be found on its GitHub
repository at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin.

We hope you enjoy using this plugin, and look forward to hearing any feedback,
bugs, or suggestions you have on the GitHub repo above.

Thanks!
